# Does Linux accept GitHub PRs yet?

This is [a silly website](https://does-linux-accept-github-prs-yet.com/) that you can refresh in your browser that gives the current status of the [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) GitHub PR policy.

Disclaimer: Linux is an incredible feat of FOSS development, and this site is purely informational and/or related to [a joke on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/retr0.id/post/3kvbiqru3fj2k) for developers who can't read their emails.
